Impliments algorithms and visualization for maintaining a set of Users that
can act as Students, Coaches, or neither. A 'total infection' is when one
person has its version of software upgraded. This leads to every person on
that connected component of the graph to also be upgraded. A 'limited infection'
is when the manager wants to upgrade x people to a certain version throughout
the entire graph.

Two main files:

infections.py
	- manages the backend in the User class

visualization.py
	- model-view-controller based tkinter application to visualize graph 

HOWTO:

python main.py test
	- this will run the tests for the graph algorithm

python main.py visualize
	- will launch the visualizer
